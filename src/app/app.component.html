<router-outlet></router-outlet>

<!-- points to note -->
<!-- This is the main entry point for the Angular application.
    The <router-outlet> directive is used to display the routed components
    based on the current URL. -->
<!-- The content inside <router-outlet> will be replaced by the component
    that matches the current route defined in the application's routing module. -->
<!-- This allows for dynamic content rendering based on user navigation. -->
